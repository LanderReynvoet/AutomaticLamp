# AutomaticLamp

For the module “Project III - International Project” we decided to make a tutorial and script on how to automatically set up a LAMP stack. 

The script is intended for a Linux distro, Debian 10 - Buster. It automatically installs all parts of the LAMP stack and configures them according to the users input. 

We also recorded a video. It explains in detail how the user should run through the script and help him understand what is happening by the feedback given by the script itself.
