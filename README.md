# AutomaticLamp
For the module “Project III - International Project” we decided to make a tutorial and script on how to automatically set up a LAMP stack. 

Now what is a stack you may ask yourself . 
It is possible to visualize stack  as a carddeck where you have multiple technologies on top of each other. 

LAMP is acronym where:
L-> Stands for Linux this is the operating system of the stack
A-> Stands for Apache this is the webserver in the stack
M-> Stands for MySQL this is the database management system in the stack
P-> Stands for PHP this is the programming language in the stack
